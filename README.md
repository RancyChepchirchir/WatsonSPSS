# Build your Machine Learning models the easy way with SPSS

## Introduction

This tutorial explains how to graphically build and evaluate machine learning models by using the SPSS Modeler flow feature in IBM® Watson™ Studio. [IBM Watson SPSS Modeler](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsd/spss-modeler.html) flows in Watson Studio provide an interactive environment for quickly building machine learning pipelines that flow data from ingestion to transformation to model building and evaluation, without needing any code. This tutorial introduces the SPSS Modeler components and explains how you can use them to build, test, evaluate, and deploy models.

As with the other tutorials in this learning path, we use a customer churn data set that is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sandipdatta/customer-churn-analysis/notebook#Churn-Analysis).
